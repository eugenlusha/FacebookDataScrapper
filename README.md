This study aims to offer a new and effective method for extracting the necessary data for social network analysis, with a special focus on Facebook. The data will be extracted from HAR (HTTP Archive) files, which are generated by every modern browser and store the history of all requests made by the browser, along with the data sent and received. These HAR files contain a large amount of information that can be used to create a detailed view of interactions on the social network. After extracting this valuable data, it will be processed to create .graphml files. These files can be used to visualize and analyze the connections between users, posts, reactions, and comments made by users. This format allows for a clear and structured presentation of the data, enabling advanced analysis of behavioral patterns on the social network and identifying important links between different elements of the platform. Essentially, this method facilitates the extraction of valuable information for researchers and data analysts while avoiding issues related to privacy rights, APIs, and web scraping.
